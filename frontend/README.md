------------ FLASH FITNESS GYM WEBSITE ------------
Built with React, Redux, and Bootstrap (Reactstrap)


This website is a mock website for a local gym. It features 5 pages, listed below with their descriptions.

------------ Home ------------
The home page features basic info about the Flash Fitness gym and its atmosphere.



------------ Workout Builder ------------
The Workout Builder page allows the user to create a custom tailored weekly workout plan. 
The interface allows a user to choose from a list of exercises, selecting a specific amount of sets and reps.
Once the user clicks on "Add Exercises to Day", they will be added to the first day which is Monday. The user may then repeat this for the rest of the days of the week.

Considerations:
- Currently there is no funcitionality to add the tame exercise multiple times to the same day.
- There is also a bug that needs to be fixed where the sets and reps for an exercise should be set before adding them to the left section (the Daily Workout Schedule section)
